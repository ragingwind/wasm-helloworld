# rust-thread example

> Build thread with Rust and wasm-bindgen, custom worker.js. It's kind of snippets from origin source, [raytrace-paraller](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/tree/master/examples/raytrace-parallel) to understand how thread works in Rust. It would be updated to more practical example.

# How to run
